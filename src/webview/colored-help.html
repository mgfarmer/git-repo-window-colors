        <h1>⚡ Colored Keys Guide</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Colored</strong> tab is a dynamic overview that automatically shows all VS Code theme keys 
            you've assigned colors to in the current profile. It provides a centralized view of your active 
            customizations, making it easy to review all your color assignments in one place.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Colored Tab?</h2>

        <p>
            Unlike the other mapping tabs (Titlebar, Activitybar, Statusbar, etc.) which show all available keys 
            in their respective sections, the Colored tab is a <strong>filtered view</strong> that displays only 
            the keys you've explicitly customized in the current profile.
        </p>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>⚡ Key Difference:</strong> The Colored tab is read-only in the sense that you cannot 
            add new keys to it directly. It automatically populates as you assign colors to keys in other tabs. 
        </div>

        <h2>How Keys Appear in the Colored Tab</h2>

        <p>
            A theme key appears in the Colored tab when you:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Assign a <strong>Palette Slot</strong> (Primary, Secondary, Accent1-3, etc.) to it</li>
            <li>Set a <strong>Fixed Color</strong> for it</li>
            <li>Adjust its <strong>Opacity</strong> from the default</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Keys with no assignment (default state) do NOT appear in the Colored tab. 
            Only keys you've explicitly configured are shown.
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding the Tab Badge</h2>

        <p>
            The badge on the Colored tab shows the total number of keys you've customized in the current profile:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>⚡ 15</strong> means you've assigned colors to 15 different theme keys</li>
            <li>The badge updates in real-time as you add or remove color assignments</li>
            <li>Setting a key to "none" still counts as a customization (it's an explicit choice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working with Colored Keys</h2>

        <h3>Viewing Your Customizations</h3>

        <p>
            Click on the <strong>⚡ Colored</strong> tab to see all your active color assignments grouped by section. 
            Keys appear in the same order and organization as the regular tabs, but only showing what you've customized.
        </p>

        <h2>Empty Colored Tab</h2>

        <p>
            If you haven't assigned any colors yet, the Colored tab displays:
        </p>

        <div class="example">
            <em>"No color mappings yet. Assign colors in other tabs to see them here."</em>
        </div>

        <p>
            Navigate to any other tab (Titlebar, Activitybar, etc.) and start assigning colors. Those keys will 
            automatically appear in the Colored tab.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Cases and Workflows</h2>

        <h3>Quick Profile Review</h3>

        <p>
            When you want to see what you've customized in a profile without browsing through all the sections, 
            the Colored tab gives you an instant overview of all your active changes with hyperlinke to take you 
            directly to each key's source.
        </p>

        <h2>Colored vs. Starred Tabs</h2>

        <p>
            While both tabs provide filtered views, they serve different purposes:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Colored Tab</th>
                <th>Starred Tab</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Automatic:</strong> Shows keys you've assigned colors to
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Manual:</strong> Shows keys you've manually starred
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Profile-Specific:</strong> Different profiles show different keys
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Global:</strong> Same starred keys across all profiles
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Keys appear/disappear based on assignments
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Persistent:</strong> Keys remain until you unstar them
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> See what you've customized
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Quick access to frequently used keys
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Workflow:</strong><br>
            You might have a "Work" profile with 20 customized keys (shown in Colored tab) and 10 starred 
            keys. The starred keys are the ones you customize across all profiles, while the Colored tab 
            shows what you've actually configured in this specific profile.
        </div>
