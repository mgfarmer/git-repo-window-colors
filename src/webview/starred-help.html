        <h1>⭐ Starred Keys Guide</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Starred</strong> tab provides a convenient way to collect and manage your most frequently 
            used VS Code theme keys in one place. Instead of searching through multiple tabs (Titlebar, Activitybar, 
            Statusbar, etc.) to find the elements you customize most often, you can star them and access them all 
            in a single dedicated tab.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Starred Tab?</h2>

        <p>
            When working with profiles, VS Code provides hundreds of theme keys that control different parts of 
            the interface. The Starred tab is your personal collection of keys you use most frequently. It acts 
            as a quick-access panel for customizing the elements you care about most.
        </p>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> The Starred tab is especially useful when you have a set of keys you 
            modify across multiple profiles. Instead of navigating through multiple tabs each time, you can 
            access all your favorite keys in one place.
        </div>

        <h2>How to Star Keys</h2>

        <p>
            Starring a key is simple and can be done from any profile mapping tab:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open a profile in the <strong>Profiles</strong> tab</li>
            <li>Navigate to any mapping tab (Titlebar, Activitybar, Statusbar, etc.)</li>
            <li>Find the theme key you want to star</li>
            <li>Click the <strong>☆</strong> (empty star) icon next to the key name</li>
            <li>The star will become filled <strong>★</strong>, indicating it's starred</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The key will now appear in the <strong>Starred</strong> tab for easy access.</p>

        <h2>Managing Starred Keys</h2>

        <h3>Viewing Starred Keys</h3>

        <p>
            Click on the <strong>★ Starred</strong> tab in the profile mapping section to see all your starred keys 
            in one place. The tab badge shows how many keys you've starred.
        </p>

        <h3>Unstarring Keys</h3>

        <p>
            To remove a key from your starred collection:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Starred</strong> tab (or find the key in any other tab)</li>
            <li>Click the <strong>★</strong> (filled star) icon next to the key</li>
            <li>The star will become empty <strong>☆</strong>, and the key will be removed from the Starred tab</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Unstarring a key does NOT remove its color mapping. It only removes the key 
            from the Starred tab. The color mapping remains active in the profile.
        </div>

        <h3>Assigning Colors to Starred Keys</h3>

        <p>
            Once you have keys starred, you can assign colors to them just like in any other tab:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Select a <strong>Palette Slot</strong> from the dropdown (Primary, Secondary, Accent1-3, etc.)</li>
            <li>Optionally adjust the <strong>Opacity</strong> slider to make the color more or less transparent</li>
            <li>Or use <strong>Fixed Color</strong> to assign a specific color independent of the palette</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Understanding the Starred Tab Badge</h2>

        <p>
            The badge on the Starred tab provides quick insights into your color mappings:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Normal Badge (Number):</strong> Shows the total number of starred keys that have colors assigned
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>⚠️ Warning Badge (X/Y):</strong> Appears when you have uncolored starred keys
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X</strong> = Number of starred keys with colors</li>
                    <li><strong>Y</strong> = Number of starred keys without colors</li>
                    <li>The badge turns <strong>yellow</strong> to draw attention</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            A badge showing <strong>⚠️ 5/3</strong> means you have 5 starred keys with colors assigned and 
            3 starred keys that don't have colors yet.
        </div>

        <h2>Uncolored Key Warnings</h2>

        <p>
            When viewing the Starred tab, any keys that don't have colors assigned will display a warning indicator:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>⚠️ warning icon</strong> appears before the dropdown</li>
            <li>This visual reminder helps you identify which starred keys still need colors</li>
            <li>The warning disappears once you assign a color to the key</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Use the warning indicators to quickly identify incomplete mappings 
            in your starred collection. This is especially helpful when setting up a new profile or ensuring 
            all your important elements are colored.
        </div>

        <h2>Starred Keys Across Profiles</h2>

        <p>
            Your starred keys collection is <strong>global</strong> and persists across all profiles. This means:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keys starred in one profile will appear in the Starred tab of all profiles</li>
            <li>You only need to star a key once, and it's available everywhere</li>
            <li>Different profiles can have different colors for the same starred keys</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Workflow:</strong><br>
            You might star <code>titleBar.activeForeground</code>, <code>activityBar.background</code>, 
            and <code>statusBar.background</code> as your core elements. These will appear in the Starred 
            tab for all your profiles, but you can assign different colors in your "Dark Theme" profile 
            versus your "Light Theme" profile.
        </div>

        <h2>Empty Starred Tab</h2>

        <p>
            If you haven't starred any keys yet, the Starred tab will display a helpful message:
        </p>

        <div class="example">
            <em>"No starred keys yet. Click the star icon next to any mapping key to add it here."</em>
        </div>

        <p>
            Simply navigate to any other tab and start starring the keys you use most frequently!
        </p>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Star Your Essential Keys:</strong> Focus on the 10-20 keys you modify most often 
                across different profiles
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keep It Organized:</strong> The Starred tab shows keys in the same order they appear 
                in the regular tabs, grouped by section
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use for Quick Edits:</strong> When fine-tuning colors, the Starred tab lets you 
                adjust your core elements without navigating between multiple tabs
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Monitor Warnings:</strong> Check the badge warning to ensure all your important 
                keys are colored
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>

        <h3>Creating a Consistent Look</h3>

        <p>
            Star the primary keys you want to customize (titlebar, activitybar, statusbar backgrounds) 
            and quickly apply your palette across all of them from the Starred tab.
        </p>

        <h3>Experimenting with Colors</h3>

        <p>
            Star a set of related keys (like all editor group borders) and experiment with different 
            slot assignments and opacities in one view.
        </p>

        <h3>Maintaining Multiple Profiles</h3>

        <p>
            When you have several profiles (work, personal, presentation), star your core keys and 
            use the Starred tab to quickly configure each profile's version of those elements.
        </p>
