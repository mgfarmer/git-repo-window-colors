## üí° How It Works

### Repository Rules (Primary Feature)

Configure colors for specific repositories. Rules are matched in priority order:

- **Repository Qualifier:** Part of your repo URL (e.g., `my-project`, `github.com/company/app`)
- **Primary Color:** Main window color for this repository  
- **Branch Color:** [Optional] different color for non-default branches
- **Default Branch:** [Optional] Specify your preferred main branch name (default is master|main) for branch-specific coloring.

### Branch Rules (Advanced Feature)

Create patterns that work across ALL repositories:

- **Pattern:** Regular expression matching branch names
- **Color:** Applied when pattern matches

**Examples:**

- `feature/.*:purple` ‚Üí All feature branches are purple
- `hotfix.*:red` ‚Üí All hotfix branches are red  
- `JIRA-123.*:orange` ‚Üí Specific ticket work is orange
