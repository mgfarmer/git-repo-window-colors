## ‚ö° Why You Need This

**The Problem:** You're a productive developer with many VS Code windows open across different repositories. They all look identical. You waste precious seconds (or minutes, or YEARS!) figuring out which window contains which project.

**The Solution:** Automatic, intelligent color-coding that makes every repository instantly recognizable at a glance.

‚úÖ **Instant Recognition** - Spot the right window immediately  
‚úÖ **Zero Manual Work** - Automatic coloring based on Git repository  
‚úÖ **Highly Customizable** - Fine-tune colors for your workflow  
‚úÖ **Branch-Aware** - Different colors for feature branches, hotfixes, etc.  
‚úÖ **Taskbar Integration** - Colored thumbnails in Windows/Mac/Linux dock previews

### 1. Install & Configure (2 minutes)

1. **Install** the extension from VS Code marketplace
2. **Open Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. **Run:** `GRWC: Open Configuration`
4. **Add your first rule** - Click "+ Add" in Repository Rules
5. **Done!** Your workspace now has a unique color identity
6. **More!** Tune the color to your liking, click on the color swatch

### 2. Recommended VS Code Settings

These global settings are required for the best visual experience:

## üí° How It Works

### Repository Rules (Primary Feature)

Configure colors for specific repositories. Rules are matched in priority order:

- **Repository Qualifier:** Part of your repo URL (e.g., `my-project`, `github.com/company/app`)
- **Primary Color:** Main window color for this repository  
- **Branch Color:** [Optional/Legacy] different color for non-default (or default) branches
- **Default Branch:** [Optional/Legacy] Specify your preferred main branch name for branch-specific coloring.
- **Branch Rules:** Check out the Branch Rules section below for a more powerful branch coloring system.

### Branch Rules (Advanced Feature)

Create patterns that work across ALL repositories:

- **Pattern:** Regular expression matching branch names
- **Color:** Applied when pattern matches

**Examples:**

- `feature/.*:purple` ‚Üí All feature branches, regardless of repository, are purple
- `hotfix.*:red` ‚Üí All hotfix branches, regardless of repository, are red  
- `JIRA-123.*:orange` ‚Üí Specific ticket work, regardless of repository, is orange

Just like Repo Rules, you can tune the color to your preferences.

Unlike Repo Rules, which use a simple string.includes pattern, Branch Rules are regular expressions
able to match any complexing branch naming strategy.
