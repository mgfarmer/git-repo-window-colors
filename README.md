# Git Repo Window Colors

**Never lose track of which repository you're working in again.**

Transform your VS Code experience by automatically applying distinctive colors to your workspace based on the Git repository you have open. Perfect for developers juggling multiple projects, this extension provides instant visual identification across all your VS Code windows.

## ‚ö° Why You Need This

**The Problem:** You're a productive developer with 5+ VS Code windows open across different repositories. They all look identical. You waste precious seconds (or minutes) figuring out which window contains which project.

**The Solution:** Automatic, intelligent color-coding that makes every repository instantly recognizable at a glance.

‚úÖ **Instant Recognition** - Spot the right window immediately  
‚úÖ **Zero Manual Work** - Automatic coloring based on Git repository  
‚úÖ **Highly Customizable** - Fine-tune colors for your workflow  
‚úÖ **Branch-Aware** - Different colors for feature branches, hotfixes, etc.  
‚úÖ **Taskbar Integration** - Colored thumbnails in Windows/Mac dock previews

## üí° How It Works

### Repository Rules (Primary Feature)

Configure colors for specific repositories. Rules are matched in priority order:

- **Repository Qualifier:** Part of your repo URL (e.g., `my-project`, `github.com/company/app`)
- **Primary Color:** Main window color for this repository  
- **Branch Color:** Optional different color for non-default branches
- **Default Branch:** Specify main branch (master/main) for branch-specific coloring

**Example:** `my-app:blue|green` ‚Üí Blue for main branch, green for feature branches

### Branch Rules (Advanced Feature)

Create patterns that work across ALL repositories:

- **Pattern:** Regular expression matching branch names
- **Color:** Applied when pattern matches

**Examples:**

- `feature/.*:purple` ‚Üí All feature branches are purple
- `hotfix.*:red` ‚Üí All hotfix branches are red  
- `JIRA-123.*:orange` ‚Üí Specific ticket work is orange
